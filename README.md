## MP3 Player

Audio is as important as text today if not more important. Since audio files are digital files, you’ll need a tool that can play them. Without a player, you’ll never be able to listen to the contents of an audio file.

This is where the MP3 Player comes in. The MP3 Player is a device for playing MP3s and other digital audio files. This MP3 Player GUI project idea attempts to emulate the physical MP3 Player. You can build software that allows you play an MP3 files on your desktop or laptop computer.

When you are done building the MP3 Player project, users can play their MP3 files and other digital audio files without having to purchase a physical MP3 Player. They’ll be able to play the MP3 files using their computers.

### Examples of MP3 Players

Here are some implementations of the MP3 Player idea:

## Technical Details

The main objective of this project is to allow users to play MP3 and digital audio files. To be engaging for users, the application has to have a simple but beautiful user interface.

You can have an interface for listing the available MP3 files. You can also give users the option to list other digital audio files that are not MP3.

The users will also expect the MP3 Player to have an interface that shows information on the file that is playing. Some of the information you can include are the name of the file, its length, the amount played, and the amount not played, in minutes and seconds.

Python has libraries that can play audio files, such as pygame, which allows you to work with multimedia files in few lines of code. You can also check out pymedia and simpleaudio.

These libraries can handle a lot of digital audio files. They can handle other file types, not just the MP3 files.

You can also implement a feature that allows users to create a playlist. To do this, you’ll need a database to store information on the created playlists. Python’s sqlite3 module allows you to use the SQLite database.

The SQLite database is a better option in this case, because it is file based and easier to set up than other SQL databases. While SQLite is file based, it is better for saving data than a regular file.

### _Extra Challenge_

For a more exciting challenge, you can add a feature to allow the MP3 player to repeat currently playing files or even shuffle the list of files to be played.

It’s also possible to implement a feature that allows users to increase and decrease the playing speed of the audio file. Users will find this interesting, as they’ll be able to play files at a slower or faster pace than usual.MP3 Player
